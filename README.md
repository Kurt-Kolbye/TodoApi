# TodoApi

## Goal
I built out an API that allowed updates to ToDo records and assigning Labels to To Dos.

## Experience Gained
The project gave me experience and insights into:

* building a C# REST Web API using ASP.NET Core,
* using Postman for testing the API,
* using Entity Framework Core,
* leveraging dependency injection in my controllers and services,
* and separating out my Data Access, Business, and Client (controllers) layers.

I also built a minimal website [here] (https://github.com/Kurt-Kolbye/TodoWebsite) to access the API which creates To Dos and Labels. This gave me experience into configuring and understanding CORS policies with the API as well.

## Summary

Overall, this project was a great one to gain more experience working with ASP.NET Core, building a REST API, separating out my application layers logically, and overcoming the challenges faced with this kind of project.
